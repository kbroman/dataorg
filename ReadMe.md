## Data Organization: A tutorial

This is a tutorial on organizing data in spreadsheets.

View the thing [here](http://kbroman.org/dataorg).

I would be glad for suggestions or corrections. If you edit the files
in the
[`pages`](https://github.com/kbroman/dataorg/tree/gh-pages/pages)
subdirectory, only edit the `.Rmd` files; the `.md` files are built
from the `.Rmd` files with [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/).
To compile the files, you'll need the
[R/broman](https://github.com/kbroman/broman) package; install it with
`devtools::install_github("kbroman/broman")`.
