## Data Organization: A tutorial

This is a tutorial on organizing data in spreadsheets.

View the thing [here](https://kbroman.org/dataorg).

I would be glad for suggestions or corrections.

With the help of [Kara Woo](https://karawoo.com), this website is now
a proper article, available at
[GitHub](https://github.com/kbroman/Paper_DataOrg),
[PeerJ Preprints](https://peerj.com/preprints/3183/), and in press at
_The American Statistician_
([doi:10/gdz6cm](https://doi.org/gdz6cm)).

If you edit the files in the
[`pages`](https://github.com/kbroman/dataorg/tree/gh-pages/pages)
subdirectory, only edit the `.Rmd` files; the `.md` files are built
from the `.Rmd` files with [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/).  To
compile the files, you'll need the
[R/broman](https://github.com/kbroman/broman) package; install it with
`install.packages("broman")`.
